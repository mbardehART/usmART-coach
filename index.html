## About USM

Unified Service Management (USM) is a method that enables service organizations to structure, standardize, and continuously improve the way services are delivered — using one universal management system that applies across all domains.

USM focuses on people, processes, and technology — and provides repeatable ways to convert customer needs into predictable, high-quality results.

## USM Workflow Decision Tree

This decision model helps you select the correct workflow based on whether the trigger is reactive or proactive, and whether it relates to an agreement, a failure, or an action.

## USM Process & Workflow Model

All USM workflows follow the same structured logic — enabling clarity, repeatability, and measurable outcomes across every service domain.

## Engagements & Services {#engagements}

USM is most powerful when it’s translated into **simple, practical routines** that fit your organization.  
I typically work with clients in a few flexible ways:

### 1. Executive Briefing & Vision Alignment

**Goal:** Give leaders a clear, shared picture of USM and how it supports their strategy.  

- 2–3 hour interactive session (onsite or remote)  
- Explains the 5 processes, 8 workflows, and decision tree in business language  
- Connects USM to your current challenges (governance, tooling, silos, customer experience)  
- Suitable for: boards, CIO/CTO, heads of IT / Operations / Facilities

---

### 2. USM Quick Scan & Roadmap

**Goal:** Understand where you are today and identify the most valuable first steps.  

- Short assessment of your current processes, teams, and tools  
- Uses the USM maturity and value perspectives (control, quality, costs, compliance)  
- Delivers a **prioritized improvement roadmap** (3–6 months) with concrete actions  
- Ideal when you are:
  - Preparing for outsourcing / insourcing  
  - Considering a new service desk / ESM tool  
  - Merging teams into a shared service center

---

### 3. Guided USM Deployment & Coaching

**Goal:** Implement USM step-by-step, with your own people in the driver’s seat.  

- Follows the USM deployment phasing (intake → set-up → improvement sprints → handover)  
- Focus on:
  - Defining services and agreements (CTM)  
  - Designing workflows and RACI (CHM, INC, OPS, RIM)  
  - Configuring your SDC / ESM tool to support USM workflows  
- Coaching style: “learn by doing” – your team applies USM on real cases, not theory  
- Can start small (one team or domain) and grow to enterprise level

---

### 4. Tooling & Workflow Design Support

**Goal:** Make your service desk / ESM tool truly reflect USM – instead of the other way around.  

- Support for designing:
  - Call types and workflows
  - Templates for wishes, changes, incidents, service requests, risks
  - MIR structure (services, MICs, relationships)  
- Neutral guidance: I don’t sell tools – I help you get the most from the one you choose.

---

### 5. Training, Workshops & Coaching Circles

**Goal:** Build internal capability so USM becomes “how we work”, not “a project”.  

- Role-based sessions (service managers, process/workflow managers, tool owners, service desk)  
- Scenario-based exercises using your own examples  
- Optional ongoing **USM coaching circle** for key practitioners and champions
