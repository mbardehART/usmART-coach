## Overview {#hero}

Unified Service Management (USM) is a **universal management system for services**.  
It gives any service organization – IT, HR, Facilities, Telecom, Government, etc. – one simple way to:

- Turn **wishes, changes, incidents, requests, and risks** into predictable results  
- Standardize **processes, workflows, teams, and tooling**  
- Improve **quality, control, and customer experience** while managing cost

This site brings together:

- Executive-level explanation
- Chapter-by-chapter summaries of the USM book
- Visual models (processes, workflows, decision tree, “subway maps”)
- Practical guidance & coaching options

## Chapter Summaries {#chapters}

### Chapter 1 – Why Services & Why USM?

- Modern organizations create value mainly **through services**, not products  
- USM adopts a **Service-Dominant (S-D) logic**: value is co-created with the customer  
- Defines key concepts: service, value, customer experience, quality  
- Shows why we need **one simple, generic system** instead of many fragmented frameworks

---

### Chapter 2 – Principles & Architecture

- USM is built on a small set of **business principles** (e.g. “structure by segmenting and managing relationships”)  
- Introduces the **enterprise service management architecture** (ESMA)  
- Defines **5 generic processes** and **8 workflows** as the core of the management system  
- Explains the **maturity/value perspectives**: control, quality, cost, compliance, customer value

---

### Chapter 3 – Customer, Services & Agreements

- Focus on **customer-driven service delivery** and co-creation of value  
- Defines services, service units, and the **service catalog**  
- Explains agreements:
  - SA (Service Agreement) – with the customer  
  - OLA (Operational Level Agreement) – internal  
  - UC (Underpinning Contract) – external provider  
- Introduces **SERVQUAL** and **UX/CX** as lenses for perception of quality

---

### Chapter 4 – People & Organization Basics

- Distinguishes between:
  - **Process model** (how work should flow)
  - **Organization model** (how people and teams are arranged)  
- Introduces **functions, roles, profiles, TAR** (Tasks, Authorities, Responsibilities)  
- Shows why a **matrix organization** works well for services  
- RACI is positioned as a way to link **profiles ↔ process steps**

---

### Chapter 5 – Processes & Process Model

- The 5 USM processes:
  - **CTM – Agree** (contract/relationship management)
  - **CHM – Change**
  - **INC – Recover**
  - **OPS – Operate**
  - **RIM – Improve / Risk**  
- Shows the **color-coded process model** and how triggers (wish, RFC, incident, service request, risk) flow through it  
- RIM “wraps around” the other four processes as a continuous improvement loop

---

### Chapter 6 – Workflows & Activities

- Processes are turned into **8 standardized workflows** that cover all reactive & proactive work  
- Each workflow is a **fixed sequence of generic steps** (accept, classify, specify, plan, execute, evaluate)  
- Workflows are reusable patterns:
  - Same structure across all domains
  - Different content per organization  
- Enables **tooling and templates** to be set up once and reused widely

---

### Chapter 7 – The Service Organization

- Connects USM to classical organization topics:
  - **Mission, vision, core values, strategy, objectives**
  - **Governance vs management**
  - **Planning & control** at strategic, tactical, operational levels  
- Explains **domain separation** (specify vs realize), **separation of duties**, and drama triangles  
- Describes **sourcing, outsourcing, insourcing, multisourcing** and their risks  
- Details **teams, profiles, RACI, service desk**, and dangers of combining conflicting roles

---

### Chapter 8 – Technology Resources

- Describes the **resource spectrum**:
  - Service delivery coordination (SDC) / service desk tools
  - MIR (Managed Infrastructure Register)
  - Knowledge, PPM, reporting, monitoring, intranet, etc.  
- Compares **ERP vs Best-of-Breed** strategies
- Defines requirements for a **USM-capable SDC tool**:
  - Workflow templates for each USM workflow
  - Single call database
  - Integrated MIR
  - Self-service portal
  - Reporting & interfaces

---

### Chapter 9 – Deploying USM

- USM deployment = **learning to apply the method**  
- Phasing:
  1. Intake & scope
  2. Planning & setup
  3. First improvement sprint
  4. Ongoing sprints (“Learn” phase)
  5. Transfer to standing organization  
- Organizational change management is central (attitude, behavior, culture)  
- Shows how USM works **with** Agile, DevOps, Lean, Design Thinking, and other techniques  
- Explains USM’s role in **shared service centers (SSC/iSSC)** and **compliance with standards** (ISO, COBIT, etc.)

## USM Process & Workflow Model {#model}

USM has **5 processes** (vertical blocks) and **8 workflows** (horizontal patterns that cross those processes).

![USM Processes & Workflows Overview](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflows.png)

**Processes (colors):**

- **Blue – CTM (Agree):** services, catalog, and agreements with customers & suppliers  
- **Yellow – CHM (Change):** structured change of the managed infrastructure  
- **Red – INC (Recover):** restore service after a failure or incident  
- **Green – OPS (Operate):** planned, routine delivery of agreed services  
- **Orange – RIM (Improve):** risks, improvements, and continual learning

These processes are combined into **8 workflows**, which we’ll visualize below.

---

## Workflow Decision Tree {#decision-tree}

The decision tree helps you select the correct workflow quickly by asking a few simple questions:

1. Is the trigger **reactive or proactive**?
2. Does it relate to the **agreement**, a **failure**, or an **action**?
3. Does the action require a **change to the managed infrastructure**?

![USM Workflow Decision Tree](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-decision-tree.png)

![USM Workflow Decision Tree Detail](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-decision-tree-detail.png)

The colored blocks at the top of each branch show which **workflow** you’ll use (1–8) and which processes are involved (CTM, CHM, INC, OPS, RIM).

---

## Workflow Subway Maps {#subway-maps}

Each workflow is drawn like a **subway line**: same sequence of steps, different “stations” (activities) per organization.

### Workflow 1 – Agreement Update / Issue

Triggered when:  
> There is an issue in the agreement or the agreement needs to be updated.

![Workflow 1 subway map](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-1-subway-map.png)

---

### Workflow 2 – Action Requiring Change

Triggered when:  
> The caller needs an action **and** that action requires a change to the managed infrastructure.

![Workflow 2 subway map](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-2-subway-map.png)

---

### Workflow 3 – Failure Requiring Change

Triggered when:  
> There is a failure **and** recovery requires a change.

![Workflow 3 subway map](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-3-subway-map.png)

---

### Workflow 4 – Failure Recovery (No Change)

Triggered when:  
> There is a failure, but recovery does **not** require a change to the managed infrastructure.

![Workflow 4 subway map](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-4-subway-map.png)

---

### Workflow 5 – Action (No Change)

Triggered when:  
> The caller requests an action that does **not** require a change.

![Workflow 5 subway map](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-5-subway-map.png)

---

### Workflow 6 – Wish Assessment

Triggered when (proactive):  
> There is a **wish** for something new or different.

![Workflow 6 subway map](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-6-subway-map.png)

---

### Workflow 7 – Proactive Change

Triggered when (proactive):  
> A planned **change** is needed (e.g., improvement, preventive work).

![Workflow 7 subway map](/assets/images/usm/usm-workflow-7-subway-map.png)

---

### Workflow 8 – Proactive Service Request / Measure

Triggered when (proactive):  
> A **service request / measure** arises from risk management or improvement work.

## Engagements & Services {#engagements}

USM is most powerful when it’s translated into **simple, practical routines** that fit your organization.

I typically support organizations in these ways:

### 1. Executive Briefing & Vision Alignment

- 2–3 hour interactive session (onsite or remote)  
- Explains the 5 processes, 8 workflows, and decision tree in **business language**  
- Links USM to:
  - Governance & risk
  - Customer satisfaction
  - Tooling and silos
- Outcome: shared understanding and **clear “why”** for USM

---

### 2. USM Quick Scan & Roadmap

- Short assessment of:
  - Current services and agreements
  - Processes, teams, and tools
  - Pain points and risks  
- Uses USM maturity/value model (control, quality, cost, compliance)  
- Delivers a **3–6 month roadmap** with prioritized, realistic steps

---

### 3. Guided USM Deployment & Coaching

- Follows the USM deployment phasing:
  1. Intake & scope
  2. Planning & set-up
  3. First improvement sprint
  4. Subsequent sprints
  5. Transfer to standing organization  
- Focus areas:
  - Defining services & catalog (CTM)
  - Designing workflows & RACI
  - Configuring SDC / ESM tools to support USM
- Style: **“learn by doing”** – your team applies USM to real cases, not theory

---

### 4. Tooling & Workflow Design Support

- Neutral help (no tool selling) to:
  - Design call types & workflows
  - Create templates for wishes, changes, incidents, requests & risks
  - Structure the **MIR** (services, MICs, relations)
- Goal: the tool reflects **USM logic**, not the other way around

---

### 5. Training, Workshops & Coaching Circles

- Role-based training for:
  - Service managers, process/workflow managers
  - Service desk & operations teams
  - Tool owners / administrators  
- Scenario-based exercises using **your own examples**
