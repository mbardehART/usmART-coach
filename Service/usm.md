## Unified Service Management (USM)

A simple, universal way to bring order, quality, and customer focus to any service organization.

Whether you run IT, facilities, HR, manufacturing, or a shared service center, you’re facing the same challenge: many services, many tools, many teams, and too little control.

USM gives you **one coherent management system** for all your services – and Aurora Red Technology helps you put it into practice.

## What is USM?

USM (Unified Service Management) is a **universal method** for managing any service organization.

Instead of jumping from framework to framework, USM gives you:

- **One simple process model** with 5 processes and 8 workflows  
- **One way of organizing roles, responsibilities, and teams**  
- **One way of structuring tools and data**, independent of specific vendors  

You can still use ITIL, Agile, DevOps, Lean, ISO, etc. — USM provides a **clear, stable architecture** for them.

## The problems USM solves

Most service organizations struggle with:

- Fragmented frameworks and “best practices” that don’t fit together  
- Silos between IT, facilities, HR, and other support domains  
- A jungle of tools that don’t reflect how work actually flows  
- Firefighting instead of predictable, controlled service delivery  
- Difficulty proving value and quality to the business

USM addresses these by:

- **Standardizing the way you work** across teams and domains  
- **Separating thinking from doing** (specifying vs realizing)  
- **Organizing all work into 8 reusable workflows**  
- **Aligning processes, people, and tools** in one simple model

## How Aurora Red applies USM

We translate USM into four practical dimensions:

1. **People**  
   - Clear roles and profiles  
   - Separation of duties (domain separation, process vs line management)  
   - RACI and responsibilities that work in daily practice  

2. **Processes & Workflows**  
   - 5 core processes: Agree, Change, Recover, Operate, Improve  
   - 8 workflows that handle all wishes, changes, incidents, service requests, and risks  

3. **Technology & Tools**  
   - Service Delivery Coordination (SDC) tool setup  
   - Managed Infrastructure Register (MIR)  
   - Simple, integrated data model  

4. **Services & Agreements**  
   - Service catalog in customer language  
   - Clear, realistic agreements (SAs/SLAs, OLAs, UCs)  
   - KPIs and reports that reflect value, not just technical noise  

---

## Engagement approach

We typically work in four phases:

1. **Assessment & vision**  
   - Understand your current services, teams, tools, and pain points  
   - Define your “dot on the horizon” using USM language  

2. **Design & alignment**  
   - Design your USM-based process & workflow model  
   - Map roles, teams, and responsibilities  
   - Align your tooling and data (SDC, MIR, reporting)  

3. **Improvement sprints**  
   - Implement USM step by step, not big bang  
   - Each sprint delivers visible improvements in control and customer experience  

4. **Embedding & coaching**  
   - Develop internal USM champions and coaches  
   - Establish a USM Panel for continuous improvement  
   - Support audits and compliance with a clean management system

## Where USM fits best

USM is especially powerful when:

- Building or improving a **shared service center (SSC / iSSC)**  
- Preparing for **outsourcing / insourcing / re-sourcing**  
- Standardizing service delivery across **locations or business units**  
- Struggling with **too many frameworks and tools** and not enough control  
- Facing **ISO, security, and quality requirements** and needing a robust management system
