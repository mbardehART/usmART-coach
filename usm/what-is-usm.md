## What is Unified Service Management (USM)?

USM is a **generic management method** for all service organizations. It doesn’t care whether you deliver IT, facilities, HR, telecom, or public services – it gives you one **universal architecture** for:

- How you define and deliver services
- How you organize people and responsibilities
- How you structure your processes and workflows
- How you set up your tools and data

USM is **not** just another framework next to ITIL, COBIT, or Agile.  
It’s the **management system underneath** those frameworks.

## Services and value in USM

USM starts from a simple idea:

> A service is support for someone’s activities.

Key points:

- **Customer**: the party that wants a business outcome  
- **User**: the people who actually use the facility  
- **Facility**: the underlying means (buildings, IT, people, etc.)  
- **Provider**: the organization that manages the facility and delivers the service

Value is **co-created**: the provider offers well-managed services, but the customer and users must **use them effectively** to realize outcomes.

## The USM view of a service system

USM sees every service situation as a system with three core domains:

1. **Use** – where the customer and users work  
2. **Specify** – where the service is defined and agreed  
3. **Realize** – where the technical work and operations are performed

These domains can be inside one organization or spread over multiple providers. Domain separation (between **specify** and **realize**) is one of USM’s main control mechanisms.

## Why another method?

Because most organizations today suffer from:

- A mix of frameworks with overlapping and conflicting practices  
- Different vocabularies in each team and domain  
- Tools configured for modules and tickets, not for **integrated workflows**  
- A lot of “local optimizations” and very little end-to-end control

USM provides:

- **A single, simple vocabulary** for all services  
- **A single process model** (5 processes) and **8 workflows**  
- Design principles for **governance, organization, and tooling**  
- A way to map existing practices into a **clean, coherent management system**

## How USM relates to ITIL, COBIT, Agile, DevOps, Lean

USM doesn’t replace these – it **hosts** them:

- ITIL / COBIT – detailed practices → fit inside USM’s 5 processes  
- Agile / DevOps – development techniques → live mainly in the **Change** process  
- Lean / Six Sigma – improvement techniques → live mainly in **Improve (RIM)**

USM answers:  
**“How do all of these fit together in one simple system we can explain to everyone?”**
