## USM Knowledge Hub

This space collects what we’ve learned from the **USM book** and from applying USM in real organizations.

It’s meant for:

- Service managers and executives who want the **big picture**
- Practitioners who want **concrete examples**
- Teams preparing to **deploy USM** in their own environment
